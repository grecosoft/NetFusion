    The following shows a composite log associated with the web application to which the tutorial examples communicate.
    This composite log shows details of all of the plugins from which the web application is composed.  Since the web
    application proves examples for all the available plugins, there will be several entries in the log.  A business
    application service will only compose the application from plugins it needs.  The composite log only shows the 
    details for the plugins used by the host application service.
