        <p>
            A composite-application is simply a .NET host (Console/WebApi) that is build from a set of registered plugins.  Plugins are added to the application's service-collection by
            calling methods provided by <code-viewer type="net-fusion" name="Core/NetFusion.Bootstrap/Container/ICompositeContainerBuilder.cs">ICompositeContainerBuilder</code-viewer>.  
            This interface defines methods that are plugin centric and delegate to the .NET Core service-collection.  The following should be noted about the building of a composite-application:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Plugins are added to the application's service-collection when the application host starts.</li>
            <li>An application only uses the plugin's that are added to the service collection.</li>
            <li>A plugin can contain zero or more Plugin Modules.</li>
            <li>If a plugin module contains zero Plugin Modules, it is basically useless (unless the host plugin).</li>
            <li>A plugin-in module is responsible for executing logic during the building of the service-collection
                and registering services.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plugin's can be one of the following type: Host, Application, and Core.  The only difference 
                between these plugin types are the other plugins searched when finding concrete classes implementing
                interfaces defined by the plugin being loaded.  Core plugins can search all other plugin types for 
                concrete instances.  While an Application plugin, can search only other Application plugins for 
                concrete instances.  Also, Core plugins are loaded before Application plugins.  
            </li>
            <li>
                There can be one and only one Host plugin.  The host plugin is the .net core Console or WebApi
                project.
            </li>
            <li>
                Plugin modules often execute reflection based code during configuration and cache the results
                that can be used at runtime during execution.
            </li>
        </ul>

    <div class="plugin-usage">
        <h1 class="section-header">Usage Summary</h1>
        <p>
            The following will use the NetFusion.MongoDb plugins as an example plugin.
            A plugin (<code-viewer type="net-fusion" name="Integration/NetFusion.MongoDB/Plugin/MongoDbPlugin.cs">MongoDbPlugin</code-viewer> for example) is just a .net core
            assembly containing a class deriving from the <code-viewer type="net-fusion" name="Core/NetFusion.Bootstrap/Plugins/Plugin.cs">PluginBase</code-viewer> class.
            The following are the steps to create a plugin:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create class derived from PluginBase.  A plugin has the following required properties:
                <ul>
                    <li>PluginId:  Must be unique across all plugins.  Usually a GUID.</li>
                    <li>PluginType:  Specifies the type of plugin (Host, Application, or Core)</li>
                    <li>Name:  Simple name used to identify plugin.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Within the constructor of the derived PluginBase class add one or more modules
                by calling the AddModule method.  The following are the modules defined by the 
                NetFusion.MongoDB plugin:
                <ul>
                    <li><code-viewer type="net-fusion" name="Integration/NetFusion.MongoDB/Plugin/Modules/MongoModule.cs">MongoModule</code-viewer></li>
                    <li><code-viewer type="net-fusion" name="Integration/NetFusion.MongoDB/Plugin/Modules/MappingModule.cs">MappingModule</code-viewer></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the plugin to the service-collection by invoking the AppPlugin method provided by
                the ICompositeContainerBuilder interface.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The Composite Builder section explains the other API methods provided by the ICompositeContainerBuilder
            interface.
