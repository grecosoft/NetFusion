Queries are simple C# classes used to express the retrieval of resources managed by an application service.
Queries are most often dispatched from controllers contained within the WebApi project.  Queries are handled
by repositories contained within the Infra project.  Often the handlers will not load complete domain-entities
but rather query specific views for increased performance.
