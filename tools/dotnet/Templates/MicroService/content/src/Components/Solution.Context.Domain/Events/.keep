These are message types published from command-handlers contained within the App project and handled by other application
service components.  Domain Events are published to notify other application components of an updated resource.
A domain-vent can have multiple in-process message handlers and can be delivered out of process using the following 
infrastructure plug-ins:

NetFusion.RabbitMq (Direct, Topic, Fan-out)
NetFusion.Azure.Messaging (Topics)
NetFusion.Redis (Channels)
