[NetFusion.Builder]
---------------------------------

- Determine if the extension method CompositeContainer of ServiceCollectionExtensions would be best an extension method of the asp.net Core ApplicationBuilder...   This way the configuration and ServiceCollection could both be accessed from one passed reference.  But also keep the current signature so a container can be created outside of an asp.net host.  Also rename the extensions file.

- Revisit IExtendedLogger and logging before the in general before the IServiceProvider is created.


[NetFusion.Bootstrap]
--------------------------------

- Remove the Kubernetes directory to a dedicated project.


- Determine if the RegisterRequiredDefaultServices should be done elsewhere.  Or maybe only register the very simple services and also don't call it by default and have the host call public version if they want to register the services.


[NetFusion.Messaging]

[NetFusion.Messaging.Types]

- Review QueryReadModel for usage etc...

.NET Action Blocks


* Puging with an assembly referenced by other plugins (containing contracts) implemented
  to report runtime information about the pugin.  Example:  a message bus based plugin 
  could return the current number of pending RPC message responses.

* ServiceBus:  See about having a concurrent dictionary of senders for reply queues that
	are disposed in not used within a specific about of time to reduce creating each 
	time.
	
* ServiceBuss:  Batch sending can be implemented within the message-publisher by storing the ServiceBusMessage
		and its assocated publish-strategy.  Then when asked to commit the bath, group by all publish-strategies
		that are the same and send all message using that publish-strategy.


* Serilog Extension - Create an enricher to log NetFusion Extension details and remove explicit methods.
